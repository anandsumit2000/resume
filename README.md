# LaTex Resume Template
## Simple yet Elegant ATS-friendly Template


This LaTeX template is designed for creating an elegant and professional resume. It includes sections for education, projects, work experience, skills, publications, awards, and honors. The template features a clean and modern design, making it suitable for individuals in various fields.

## Pre-requisites
To use this LaTeX template on your machine, you'll need the following prerequisites:
1. LaTeX Distribution:
    There is no need to install LaTex. Just hop on to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), and upload resume.tex.
2. Source Sans Pro Font
    The repository contains the font. Upload them as well to the project in overleaf. The tex file would detect its presence in the project and work just fine.
3. Basic Understanding of LaTeX:
    While you don't need to be an expert, having a basic understanding of LaTeX commands and syntax will be helpful. LaTeX is a markup language used for document preparation. [This](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~freedman/resources/Freedman_LaTeXCheatSheet.pdf) is a link that would provide you with the glossary on the syntaxes.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you should be able to edit, compile, and generate a PDF from the LaTeX template.
